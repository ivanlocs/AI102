## Background:
MBTI is based on Jung's eight mental functions "Psychological Types" based on the combination of two psychological energies and four mental processes. It was first studied by the Briggs-Myers mother-daughter team in the United States and was published in "Psychological Types" Based on the proposed eight dominant mental functions, it enriches and refines other parts such as the auxiliary mental functions proposed by Jung, and expands it into 16 personality types. As a daughter, Myers compiled test questions based on her mother Briggs's work, enriching the obscure Jungian psychoanalytic theory into an MBTI assessment that can be understood with simple training. Trying to study the unchanging nature of human personality in order to discover personal potential talents and career directions.
